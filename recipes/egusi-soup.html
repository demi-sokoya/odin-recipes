        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Egusi soup is native to West Africa, and many of my American and Nigerian friends enjoy this recipe when I make it. Ground egusi seeds give the soup a unique flavor. It's a delicious and hearty soup for those who like to try something different every once in a while.</p>
